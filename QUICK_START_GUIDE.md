## 🔄 Monthly Reconciliation Process

### Step 1: Initiate Reconciliation (Day 5 of Month)

**Automatic:** Cron job runs at 9:00 AM on 5th of each month  
**Manual:** Use API if needed

```bash
POST /api/channel-partners/:resellerId/reconciliation/initiate
{
  "month": "2026-05"
}
```

**What happens:**
- System calculates gross commission
- Deducts partner advances
- Creates snapshot of all data
- Status: `pending`

---

### Step 2: Review Reconciliation

```bash
GET /api/channel-partners/:resellerId/reconciliation/list?status=pending
```

**Check:**
- ✅ Total realized amount correct?
- ✅ Partner advances accurate?
- ✅ Net commission looks right?
- ✅ All payments included?

---

### Step 3: Download PDF Report

```bash
GET /api/channel-partners/:resellerId/reconciliation/:id/report
```

**Review PDF:**
- Partner information
- Summary (collected, realized, deferred)
- Payment breakdown
- Advance details
- Net commission

---

### Step 4: Approve or Reject

**If everything is correct:**
```bash
POST /api/channel-partners/:resellerId/reconciliation/:id/approve
{
  "notes": "Approved for payment"
}
```

**If there's an issue:**
```bash
POST /api/channel-partners/:resellerId/reconciliation/:id/reject
{
  "reason": "Incorrect advance amount for User Ali"
}
```

---

### Step 5: After Approval

**What happens:**
- ✅ Month is locked
- ✅ PDF report generated
- ❌ Cannot modify payments for that month
- ❌ Cannot add advances for that month

**To make changes:**
1. Reject the reconciliation
2. Fix the data
3. Re-initiate reconciliation
4. Approve again

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Error: "Month is locked"

**Problem:** Trying to modify data for an approved month

**Solution:**
1. Check reconciliation status:
   ```bash
   GET /api/channel-partners/:resellerId/reconciliation/list
   ```
2. If approved, reject it first:
   ```bash
   POST /api/channel-partners/:resellerId/reconciliation/:id/reject
   {
     "reason": "Need to add missing payment"
   }
   ```
3. Make your changes
4. Re-initiate and approve

---

### Error: "Reconciliation not found"

**Problem:** Reconciliation hasn't been initiated for that month

**Solution:**
```bash
POST /api/channel-partners/:resellerId/reconciliation/initiate
{
  "month": "2026-05"
}
```

---

### Error: "Cannot reconcile future month"

**Problem:** Trying to reconcile a month that hasn't happened yet

**Solution:** Only reconcile past or current months

### Cron Job Not Running

**Check:**
```bash
ssh -p 21098 speeuvmq@199.188.200.186
pm2 logs office-api-a | grep "Reconciliation Cron"

- Runs on 5th of each month at 9:00 AM

**Manual Trigger:**
```bash
POST /api/channel-partners/:resellerId/reconciliation/initiate
{
  "month": "2026-05"
}
```

## 🔑 Key Concepts

### Service Period vs Bill Issued Date
- **Service Period:** Which month the service was provided (e.g., May)
- **Bill Issued Date:** When the bill was created (e.g., June 5)
- **Why it matters:** Commission calculated based on service period

### Realized vs Deferred
- **Realized:** Amount actually paid by user
- **Deferred:** Amount still unpaid (বকেয়া)
- **Why it matters:** Commission only on realized amount

### Billing Status
- **realized:** Fully paid
- **partial_deferred:** Partially paid
- **deferred:** Not paid yet

### Partner Advances
- Money partner paid to users directly
- Deducted from partner's commission
- Must be recorded for accurate settlement

### Reconciliation Status
- **pending:** Awaiting approval
- **approved:** Approved and locked
- **rejected:** Rejected, needs fixing
